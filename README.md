# OSMemIntegrity
Priority Based Parity Bit Assignment for Memory Integrity


This is a single-bit flip detection algorithm that uses a parity bit
No correction is possible at present

This is a simulation program to run multiple test runs
user can define word size in bits, probability of error, and allocation between priority and non priority

Scheduler reviews priority or non priority designation to assign a parity bit and perform parity checks

Report is output as a csv.
